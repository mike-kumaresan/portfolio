He was truly a great teacher, perhaps the greatest of his era and ours.
 For [him], the lecture hall was a theater, and the lecturer a performer,
 responsible for providing drama and fireworks as well as facts and figures...Wheth
er he addressed an audience of students, colleagues, or the general public,
 for those lucky enough to see [him] lecture in person, the experience was
 usually unconventional and always unforgettable, like the man himself.'

Richard Feynman is considered by many physicists and mathematicians to be
 one of the greatest teachers of all time.
 He was known to be a master in the lecture hall and many of the students
 and faculty who attended his lectures at Caltech have said that having
 physics with him was the experience of a lifetime.
 During my time as an undergraduate and graduate student, I had the pleasure
 of working my way through many of the Feynman Lectures on Physics (these
 were the lectures that Feynman gave at Caltech which were then subsequently
 published into a three volume book set).
 In reading the lectures, I experienced a small taste of what Feynman's
 students experienced in-person.
 It was clear that what I was reading was from a master teacher - someone
 who was truly an expert in his field who had spent many years in deep reflectio
n upon his subject.
 And though I did not get to experience what it was like to learn from Feynman
 in-person, reading his lectures reminded me of another great and masterful
 teacher that I had the privilege of having when I was a high school student.
 In my reflections in the Year 1 essay, I spent some time discussing the
 profound influence that Bob Arrigo had in my career and life.
 His teaching and example had a deep impact on me and many of my most cherished
 memories from my time in high school are from being in his classroom and
 interacting with him.
 It is easy to see that a large part of what made Feynman and Arrigo such
 impactful teachers was the kind of climate they were able to create in
 their classroom.
 In my own experiences as a teacher and in reflecting upon what has been
 successful throughout my career, I have identified three key elements that
 I have found to be crucial in creating a classroom that is primed for learning:
 1.
 The role of the teacher as the first and primary student and learner; 2.
 The quality of the interactions between the teacher and student; and 3.
 The importance of managing the students and the classroom.
 Let me consider each of these in turn.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, any successful environment in which students are encouraged to learn
 and take risks must begin with the example of the teacher.
 Teachers like Feynman and Arrigo are remembered not only for the information
 they disseminated, but more importantly for the kind of people that they
 were in the classroom.
 In reflecting on how I can be a thoughtful and persuasive communicator
 to my students, I have found Aristotle's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rhetorical triangle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to be a helpful framework for evaluating myself.
 Aristotle taught that a speaker's ability to persuade an audience is based
 on how well the speaker appeals to the audience in three different areas:
 logos (rational speech), pathos (proportionate emotion) and ethos (credible
 character).
 Logos appeals to reason.
 It means, quite simply, articulate content and clear speech.
 I view this as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

content knowledge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 aspect of teaching.
 Pathos refers to the emotional quality of the presentation.
 It means moving the hearers by causing their emotions to match your own.
 It refers to grasping what emotions naturally correspond to the message
 and then communicating these convincingly to the audience.
 Pathos calls for appealing not just to the head (logos) but also to the
 heart.
 I view this as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

energy and passion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in teaching.
 Finally, ethos appeals to the speaker's character.
 Or as Quintilian defined it, the good orator is simply 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vir bonus dicendi peritus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 - 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a good man, expert in speech.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ethos speaks to the idea that if you wish others to believe you, they must
 first like you, or at least find you trustworthy.
 As one author has put it, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We tolerate presenters.
 We suffer lecturers.
 We are moved by teachers.
 Think back to your college or high-school years.
 Can you recall your favorite class? Probably not.
 Yet you likely can still point to a beloved teacher.
 When you (more than what you say) hold the trust of your listeners, you,
 that is to say, your character, like a splash of swirling orange juice
 in a champagne glass, mix with the message.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 I view this as the

trust and relationship
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 aspect of teaching.
 One of my goals as a professional is to be constantly fostering my growth
 in these three areas.
 I attempt to do this in two primary ways - engaging in the discipline of
 mathematics on a regular basis, and engaging with a community of like-minded
 professionals who can challenge me and help me to grow.
 One of the disciplines I have tried to establish for myself as a professional
 is to be engaging in some kind of mathematics on a personal level as part
 of my professional responsibilities.
 It can often be easy to get consumed by the demands of teaching and lose
 sight of continuing to develop the craft and content that you are trying
 to teach to students.
 Mathematics is an inexhaustible subject and there is always much to be
 explored and learned.
 I try to make an effort to make sure I do not fall into the trap of thinking
 that I have achieved enough knowledge of the subject.
 On a practical level, this means that I try to work through several books
 or papers on some area of mathematics that I find interesting every year.
 Sometimes this is related to something I may teach to my students; but
 often, this is some type of mathematics that I find stimulating, enjoyable
 and want to explore for my own sake.
 Engaging in this discipline has helped me to develop both the logos and
 pathos in my teaching, as it helps to keep me sharp on the content and
 also helps me to grow my joy and passion for the subject.
 There is always something new and beautiful to learn, and the only way
 that I can inspire my students to push themselves to learn new things is
 if I myself am engaging in that discipline.
 Developing ethos is a much trickier proposition.
 One very important aspect of building ethos is to develop strong relationships
 with students.
 I will comment more on this below, but, in order to connect more with my
 students, I have found that it is crucial to make connections with them
 outside of the classroom.
 To that end, one of my main goals is to devote time to being involved in
 student life outside of the classroom (through coaching, advising, etc).
 Moreover, I have also found it helpful to stay connected to other professionals
 (particularly more experienced ones) who can offer me guidance and whose
 example I can follow in dealing with my students.
 The conversations I have had with my mentors at the high school (both current
 and retired) have been extremely formative in helping me to become a better
 teacher.
 I have also benefitted from working and collaborating with colleagues both
 in my department and across departments, and have learned much from them
 about how to be available and helpful to my students.
 Finally, the STI courses and other professional development opportunities
 outside of Scarsdale that I have attended (such as conferences and workshops)
 have been very helpful resources that I have used to develop my own logos,
 pathos and ethos.
 It goes without saying that I plan to continue to engage in all these activitie
s in order to become a better teacher and person, with the goal of setting
 a tone and culture of learning for the students who come into my classroom.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While developing myself is a very important part of my job, I would consider
 it a huge mistake to have myself (the teacher) at the center of everything
 that happens in the classroom.
 Rather, the classroom becomes a much more engaging, unpredictable and productiv
e space when student thinking is showcased and is at its core.
 The key to establishing this student-centered orientation in the classroom
 is the instructor-student interaction.
 I have seen a development in my teaching over the years where I have moved
 away from the traditional means of initiation and response between the
 instructor and the students, toward an emphasis on the use and development
 of student thinking.
 I now attempt (wherever I can, and to the best of my ability) to structure
 my lecturing around helping students to share and deepen their thinking,
 as well as engage with the thinking of those around them.
 I provide more concrete details on how I attempt to do this in my reflections
 in the Year 2 essay.
 But to summarize here briefly, the first important step is to create a
 classroom environment in which students feel comfortable in expressing
 their thinking.
 This type of classroom atmosphere stems largely from expressing my own
 enthusiasm and joy for the subject (see above!).
 Showing enthusiasm and approachability goes a long way toward transforming
 a student's experience from dry and difficult, to engaging and thought-provokin
g.
 However, I have found that this environment can also be created by prompting
 students in the right way.
 I have discovered that questions such as, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can you expand more on that idea?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know you haven't finished the problem yet, but what was your initial thinking?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We should not shy away from making mistakes - can you talk us through an
 initial approach you took that did not work?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to be particularly helpful.
 These types of prompts show the students that there is an expectation for
 their ideas to be shared, even if they are incorrect.
 Often times their thinking is fuzzy and lacks rigor; however, my goal in
 engaging them in discussion is not to evaluate them immediately, but to
 encourage them to make their contribution.
 Following this, a second step is to help students engage with the ideas
 and thinking of their peers.
 I use questions such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Do we agree with his idea or thinking?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Could someone re-express her argument in your own words?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Can you repeat that so the whole class can hear what you said?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to move students in this direction.
 I have seen the benefits of these kinds of interactions often in the classroom.
 Sometimes, one student arrives at a different conclusion and this leads
 to debate about who is correct and who can justify their thinking more
 precisely.
 Other times, a misunderstanding surfaces and a discussion ensues on how
 to be more precise and careful in the way we are communicating.
 All of these outcomes are productive in teaching students how to think
 mathematically and embrace risk-taking with the goal of fostering learning
 and growth.
 I have found that creating classroom interactions with students on these
 levels has helped me tremendously to achieve the goal of engaging my students
 with deep mathematical ideas in collaboration with each other.
 It gives students an active role in their own development and creates the
 kind of climate that I hope will inspire them to be independent and life-long
 learners.

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, with students at the center of the classroom, the instructor must
 play an important role in managing the students' growth and development.
 There are several ways in which I attempt to help students grow in their
 development while they are in my classroom.
 First, I have found it very helpful to establish routines for my students.
 When they come to class, they know what to expect and what to begin working
 on, whether it be a review worksheet or a new activity.
 Moreover, I have employed some technological tools such as Google Classroom
 to help me communicate effectively with students and make sure expectations
 are understood across the board.
 In addition to establishing routines for our day to day meetings, I also
 use a variety of different assessments and projects to track progress and
 offer students feedback on their growth.
 In mathematics education, in particular, in order for students to develop
 their skills, it is vital that students are constantly solving problems.
 To that end, I give students regular formative assessments as well as summative
 assessments.
 This helps me to monitor student growth and communicate clearly with my
 students about their progress and how they can be improving and learning.
 Inside the classroom, as I have mentioned above, I devote much of my energy
 to creating an open environment for learning and developing community.
 It is often in this environment that I can have side conversations with
 students or even engage the class as a whole and learn about their strengths
 weaknesses, desires and ambitions.
 I have found that students respond well to a more informal and open classroom
 and, with some time, are quick to open up and share with me and with their
 peers.
 As the rapport with my students grows stronger, I am able to bring that
 into the classroom and tailor my teaching to meet their specific needs.
 Outside of the classroom, I use office hours and conversations outside
 of the classroom to get to know my students on a deeper level.
 I consider my office hours to be an extension of my classroom, with whiteboards
 on the wall and various materials in the room so that students can use
 that space to work together and collaborate together.
 Even though most students come to office hours with questions which are
 specific to class content, I have had the opportunity to talk to many students
 during office hours on a variety of topics and offer them advice from my
 own life experience.
 These moments have been vital in helping me understand and relate to my
 students and have helped me craft my teaching to make it relevant and interesti
ng for them.
 Office hours have been a key way for me to monitor my students' progress.
 They have helped me to build stronger relationships with my students, which
 is ultimately the best way to monitor student growth.
 In my years of teaching, I have found that building strong relationships
 is the key to having a successful and impactful teacher-student relationship.
 Though imparting information is crucial in teaching, at the end of the
 day, teaching is ultimately a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

people business.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Gaining the trust and respect of my students is something I work hard to
 accomplish so that I can manage their growth and progress more effectively
 and make a difference in their lives.
