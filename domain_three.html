		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify">Instruction is the most critical work that I engage in as a teacher. Over the years,
				my teaching style has evolved as I have gained more experience. I have grown in my ability to
				communicate
				mathematics more effectively through the feedback and evalutions I have received from advisors and
				colleagues.
				But the biggest source of insight with regards to improving my teaching has been from conversations with
				my
				students.
				My reflections on these conversations have led me to a basic philosophical goal as a mathematics
				instructor -
				to effectively support my students' engagement in deep mathematical ideas and to encourage peer to peer
				collaboration among them so as to make them better and deeper thinkers. Below, you can find some
				examples
				of how I have applied this philosophy in my teaching.

	<h3>Using History and Technology to Illuminate Calculus [2019]</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>When teaching calculus, I like to give students the historical context for how Newton developed
			the ideas of calculus. I begin the course by placing the mathematics in its historical context
			and making connections between the ideas we study in the mathematics classroom with other disciplines.
			You can find my notes on the history of calculus here:

		<p>Part of the lecture focuses on the role that Archimedes played in insipiring Newton- in particular,
			his idea to approximate the area of a circle using the method of exhaustion. I wrote a simulation
			to illustrate this for the students. The video below shows Archimedes' method applied to a circle
			of radius one, with the area of the circle being printed to the left side of the screen as the number
			of sides of the inscribed polygons increases.

	<h3>Teaching Theory and Application in Algebra [2019]</h3>
	<ul>

		<blockquote>
			<p>In Math 433, when we studied fractional exponents, I wanted to have students implement a practical
				example of the ideas they just learned. To that end, I designed a lesson on fractional exponents
				applied to electric circuits. After teaching the theory, I had the class work in groups
				to physically reproduce their calculations with real-world circuits. The goal here was to show
				a real-world application of mathematics and also to emphasize the organic relationship between
				theory and application in mathematics.

	<h3>Using Activities to Foster Collaboration and Thinking [2019]</h3>
	<ul>
		<blockquote>
			<p>In Math 454, one of the most enjoyable lessons we did as a class this year was on Halloween. I designed
				an "Escape Room", in which the students had to solve Calculus problems and unlock a series of locks
				which
				would lead them to a final prize. The goal of the lesson was to have the students actively
				engaged in an activity that they would enjoy, while also reinforcing the concepts we had learned in the
				class prior to this point.

	<h3>Visualizing Mathematics in Precalculus [2022]</h3>
	<ul>

		<blockquote>
			<p>In Math 444, I wanted to show students the idea behind the proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. The FTA is a very important theorem which we use throughout the year, but its proof is technical and requires college-level analysis to understand in detail. However, I was able to illustrate the idea behind the argument in the proof by using a visual representation of the complex numbers. The color maps were helpful in explaining the important ideas in the proof and the students were able to see why the FTA is true.

	<h3>Proofs in High Honors Precalculus [2022]</h3>
	<ul>
		<blockquote>
			<p>During the 2022-2023 academic year, I had the opportunity to teach the High Honors Precalculus course
				for juniors. One of the main emphases of the class is to teach students not just computational
				mathematics, but also theoretical mathematics in which deductive reasoning is presented in the form of
				detailed proofs. Part of my contributions to the curriculum this year has been to develop some new proofs
				of key theorems that the students can work through. Below are my notes on a proof of Descartes Rule of Signs
				in which students use the theory of polynomials as well as the principle of mathematical induction.

	<h3>Advising Student Independent Studies [2021, 2022]</h3>

			<p>During the 2021-2023 academic years, I made a concerted effort to work across several Departments
				at the high school. Below is a list of collaborative activites I have engaged in with colleagues from
				different Departments.
				<br>
				<li>
					<p><b>English</b> - Natalie Farina and I are developing a system of "Graphical Essay Writing" using ideas
					from Geometry. I was able to co-teach two classes in her 11H course on this topic.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
						<p><b>Social Studies</b> - I gave several lectures in Kami Wright's Psychology course on the topic of
						Statistics and its use in the Social Sciences.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
						<p><b>Art</b> - Janna Johnsen and I have worked on developing lessons in the intersection of Math and Architecture.
						The lessons apply some of the topics in the Precalculus and Calculus curriculum to current trends in Architecture.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
						<p><b>Science</b> - I am working with Vanessa Blood to help revise and revamp the Physics Department's units on Electricity and Circuit Analysis.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
						<p><b>Language</b> - I am working with Zoe Calhoun on some Interdisciplinary lessons on the topic of French Culture and History and its intersection with Mathematics.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
						<p><b>Athletics</b> - I have worked with Ray Pappalardi and Alan Killian to automate the Athletics Department game scheduling process.

			<p>In the summer of 2022, I taught my first course for the STI. The course was a quick primer on the new
				Digital Logic Design curriculum I developed (see Domains I and IV for more details). The course focused
				on teaching colleagues some introductory circuit theory that can be used at various levels of the district
				for STEM education. The class also featured examples of robust project-based learning for students.
