		<h1><b>Domain II: The Classroom Environment</b></h1>
		<br>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify">Creating a positive environment in the classroom is an essential component
				of my work. If the atmosphere in the classroom is negative, neither the students nor myself can
				focus on learning and developing. Even though I teach in three different spaces and do not have
				my own dedicated room, I still attempt to create a similar environment in the rooms in which
				I am teaching. Whether I am teaching a mathematics or engineering class, I put a lot of effort into
				creating a culture of learning, respect and collaboration, as well as an environment in which
				expectations and routines are clear. I have found success in my teaching by emphasizing these two twin
				aspects.

	<h3>Creating a Culture of Learning and Collaboration</h3>
	<ul>
		<strong>Student-Centered Learning (Math 454 and Math 433) [2019]</strong>
		<blockquote>
			<p>In addition to traditional teaching and lecturing, I like to emphasize student-centered learning and
				teaching in my
				classroom. When students can explain concepts and ideas to each other, they demonstrate that they have
				internalized the ideas well. When appropriate, I like to have students come and do problems and
				exercises
				on the board and explain it to each other.

		<h4><strong>Group Work and Collaboration (Introductory Engineering)[2019]</strong></h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>I encourage students to work in groups when they solve problems. This allows them to listen well
				and collaborate with each other. This is an important skill they will need when they work in a job
				and the classroom is a good setting to begin developing those habits.

		<strong>Office Hours</strong>
		<blockquote>
			<p>I use my office hours to meet with students not just individually but also in groups. This
				allows me to have a discussion with them about mathematics and problem solving. It also gives me
				the opportunity to have students explain work to each other, collaborate and internalize the ideas
				more deeply without me dictating to them. I have found office hours to be a crucial component of my
				teaching in terms of developing a culture of learning and exploration.

	<strong>Red, Yellow and Green in Engineering [2021]</strong>
	<blockquote>
		<p>As a way to foster more collaboration and independence from the teacher, during the 2021-2022 academic year, I incorporated a new component into my practice. When working on projects in my elective courses (Introductory Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Digital Logic Design), I give each student three colored plastic cups - one red, one yellow and one green. While they are working, one of the cups is to be displayed on their workspace at all times. If they are progressing on their own without the need for help, the green cup should be displayed. If they are having some kind of problem that they are unsure about but is not dentrimental to moving forward, they are to display the yellow cup. When I see a yellow cup, I direct other students (who have a green cup displayed) to go help their classmate troubleshoot their issue. Finally, if they have no ability to progress after troubleshooting on their own or with a classmate, they are to display the red cup, and it is at that point that I go over to help. I have found this system easy to implement and useful in helping students become more independent. It also helps students to work with each other and learn from each other, thereby removing me as the focal point of the classroom and putting them at the center of the learning.

	<h3>Managing the Classroom through Routines and Expectations</h3>
	<ul>
		<strong>Syllabus and Course Expectations</strong>
		<blockquote>
			<p>I attempt to set up routines in my classroom to facilitate learning and development. The Syllabus
				which I give out on the first day of class helps to define expectations for the class for both the
				students and myself. Below are some examples from my Mathematics and Engineering courses.

		<strong>Class Webpage [2019]</strong>
		<blockquote>
			<p>I maintain a presence on the Scarsdale Website through my Teacher page. Students can find annoucements,
				class handouts and homework assignments organized by date. They can also find times during which
				I am holding office hours. My Teacher Page allows me to keep the class organized and also gives
				students a place to access materials they need for the class.

	<strong>Google Classroom [2021]</strong>
	<blockquote>
		<p>As a result of teaching through the pandemic during 2019-2021, I have moved away from my Class Webpage and I have adopted Google Classroom as the main content management system for my courses. I have found the interface to be intuitive and easy to work with for both myself and my students. My students have especially found it helpful for organizing work and submitting assignments. I have found it useful in helping me to keep better records of student work so I can provide more meaningful feedback throughout the duration of the course.

	<h3>The Teacher's Role</h3>
		<ul>
			<strong>Teacher Development [2020]</strong>
			<blockquote>
				<p>In my classroom, I strive to create a strong culture of learning for everyone - especially myself! As a teacher I want to model for my students what it means to take pride in one's work and give the best effort. To that end, I took two courses offered by the STI in preparation for my second year of teaching. The first was the Skillful Teacher course, which was very helpful in refining my own teaching philosophy. The second course I took (in preparation for online learning during the pandemic) was extremely helpful in helping me develop a smooth system for teaching during the 2020-2021 academic year. Below you can find the project work I did for both courses. My project on the second course was featured as a model project for the STI.

			<h3>The Physical Space</h3>
				<ul>
					<strong>Room 256 [2022]</strong>
					<blockquote>
						<p>After having taught at the high school for four years, I have been able to use
							Room 256 as my main teaching space. Room 256 is a special place for me because it was
							in that room that I sat under the teaching of Bob Arrigo, who taught me Precalculus and Calculus.
							Bob had a tremendous influence on my life and has impacted me as a person and teacher deeply. Over the last
							year, I have tried to bring posters and other visuals to the classroom in order to inspire students
							and motivate them to learn and grow. In Room 256, you can now find posters with famous formulas and
							biographies of famous mathematicians. But you can also find photos of the students that have passed
							through the room as well as projects that I or my students have built. I use all these props and pictures
							to remind students that in this space we are carrying on the great tradition that comes to us from the
							mathematicans of the past. But we are taking that tradition, innovating, building upon it and showcasing
							our own work and learning.
